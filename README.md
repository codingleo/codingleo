I'm a senior software engineer with 9+ years of experience crafting web applications. My focus is creating value through high quality software delivery using react, typescript and node.js as my main tools.

I already helped companies going from 0-1 with new products and helped improve existing ones, like social media platforms, academic conferences management tools, card collectors auction websites integrated with eBay.

I also helped companies acquire funding for getting into polkadot parachain through a crowdloan website and they win, by having $53 million funded by the community through this website.

I also love to create tools and experiments for myself, like a robot that automatically public posts on instagram in a daily basis that already has 25k+ followers.

### My expertise is:
- ⚛️ React
- ⚛️ Redux
- ⚛️ GraphQL
- 🧘🏽 ChakraUI
- ☘️ Tailwind
- 🚀 Framer Motion
